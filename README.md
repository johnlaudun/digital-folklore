# Welcome!

Memes, fake news, trolling, rickrolling are all well-established forms of internet behavior and are as much a part of our everyday lives as grandmaâ€™s gumbo. *Digital Folklore and Culture* explores the varieties and depths of these forms, from the first email forwards to the latest tiktoks and everything in between. Course activities include curating collections of multimedia materials; learning how to parse digital content; annotating, sorting, and compiling data sets; applying appropriate analytical frameworks; and exploring ways to present your ideas effectively. The course includes producing an online portfolio and learning collaborative and versioning systems to make it possible to work with others as well as secure your own work. 

This course was originally imagained as taking place in a classroom three days a week -- Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 10 to 11, to be precise -- but obviously in this pandemic moment, plans had to change. The good news is that we can have the best of both worlds: we can still talk with each other, if also through screens, but we can also be fully immersed in the digital realm that is our object of study. (You will just need to remind yourself that sometimes you're on TikTok for fun and sometimes you're on TikTok for class.)

$ give me super-powers

{% hint style="info" %}
 Super-powers are granted randomly so please submit an issue if you're not happy with yours.
{% endhint %}

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
