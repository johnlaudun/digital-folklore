# What is folklore?

There are a lot of ways to begin an exploration of folklore, especially digital folklore, and Lynne McNeill offers us one way to begin thinking about it. While her talk is titled [Folklore doesn't meme what you think it memes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PBDJ2UJpKt4), she addresses the larger questions of *what is culture?* and *how do we know who we are?* along the way.
