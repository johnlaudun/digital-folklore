### How to organize yourself

In her "[Five-step Strategy for Student Success with Online Learning](https://onlinelearninginsights.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/five-step-strategy-for-student-success-with-online-learning/),” Debbie Morrison points out some obvious things—like read the syllabus, plan weekly study times, and log onto a course at least three times a week—as well as a couple less obvious things—like learning to, and making yourself, ask questions and making connections with fellow students. 

Let’s discuss the obvious ones first, setting aside reading the syllabus and other course documents, like this one, as so obvious that anyone not "reading the docs” probably shouldn’t be trusted to operate a pencil correctly. Not as obvious are the ones that involve time management, because in comparison with a regular go-to-class class, there is no fixed time, no place you have to be. You can be anywhere at any time, and that’s just dangerous. 

It’s also tempting to try to binge a class, and sometimes that can work, but a lot of times it won’t, because your brain needs time to digest some material before it can take in more. Cramming before an exam only works, in all honesty, if you already know the material in some fashion. Cramming new material rarely works.

Pace yourself, which means setting aside time to go through the course materials *and* time to do the assigned reading and writing. The accompanying PDF is a blank weekly schedule that is there to help you block out your week. Use it not only for this class but for your other classes and for your other regular obligations. Put it some place where you will look at it everyday. And then make a note to revisit it and make changes for what works and what doesn’t. (Life is complicated: don’t make it harder than it has to be.)

As to the less obvious things you must do: *ask questions*. In most cases, you will be doing someone else a favor by asking a question they haven’t quite put into words yet. (We’re going to assume all of you are equally determined to get the most out of your education and so the second a question comes to you and you can put it in words, you are going to ask it. Okay?)

Finally, connect with someone else. In an in-person class, I ask students to do this in case they miss a class and need to get notes. In a remote class, it’s a good idea to swap notes with someone: you can see what you missed. *Make it happen*.

### Course Project

* No less than 10 examples of object of study

As a folklorist, I study anecdotes. Anecdotes are the stuff of life. They can even be objects of study. You just can't work with anecdotal evidence, in the sense that a small number of examples—sometimes only one—drawn from personal experience can serve as your data. It's perfectly fine to let your personal experience draw you towards an object of study, but once you have established that object, you need to collect (and analyze) objectively and purposefully; not casually, anecdotally.
