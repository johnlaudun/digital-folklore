# Welcome!

Depending upon how you arrived, you are either on the frontispiece/home page for _Digital Folklore and Culture_ or you are looking at the `readme` in the GitHub repository. If you are on the latter, and you can look at [the repo](https://github.com/johnlaudun/digital-folklore) if you like. If you are in the repo, and you really wish you could see this as a formatted document: there's the [GitHub pages URL](https://johnlaudun.github.io/digital-folklore/) and then there's the domain, [DigitalFolklore.net](https://digitalfolklore.net).

Once you're strong enough, save the world:

{% code title="hello.sh" %}
```bash
# Ain't no code for that yet, sorry
echo 'You got to trust me on this, I saved the world'
```
{% endcode %}
