# What is folklore?

In this unit I want to define folklore studies as the study of the vernacular, people "talking" with each other, as opposed to mass culture. The line between the two is incredibly blurred when it comes to the digital domains which we will be exploring. 

​	1.1	A Brief History of Folklore Studies

​	1.2	Orientation
