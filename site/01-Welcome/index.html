<blockquote>
<p><em>Learning [should] be not so much about saving information, like on a hard disk, but about building connections and bridges between pieces of information. &hellip; It is about making sure that the right cues trigger the right memory, about how we can think strategically to remember the most useful information when we need it.</em> &ndash; Sonke Ahrens, <em>How to Take Smart Notes</em> (2017)</p>
<p><em>Learning is a special form of dimensionality reduction</em>. &ndash; Jakob Foerster (Facebook AI Research Scientist)</p>
</blockquote>
<p>A lot of people will repeat “May you live in interesting times” and tell you it is a Chinese curse. It’s attribution to the Chinese is as beguiling as its appearance as a benediction. (For the record, according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/May_you_live_in_interesting_times">Wikipedia</a>, the closest Chinese saying is &ldquo;If you follow Better to be a dog in times of tranquility than a human in times of chaos&rdquo; [<a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/寧為太平犬，不做亂世人">寧為太平犬，不做亂世人</a>].)</p>
<p>Well, we do live in interesting times, don’t we? Normally I would assure you that the importance of our current moment or the speed of change or the qualities of change we face is just something we arrogate to ourselves, that every era has felt much the same: all you need to do is head to your local library and ask the librarian to show you newspapers from the 1940s or 50s. Coal strikes. Atom bomb tests. The Cold War. </p>
<p>But a global pandemic changes everything. It especially changes education, which is normally putting too many people into too small of a room inside buildings not well maintained. We can’t do that. And so we fall back on distance learning technologies, which are neither better nor worse than face-to-face learning technologies, but different enough that few of us excel at it. </p>
<p>So we are doing something different, and by reading this you are already in the middle of that difference: to the best of my ability, I hope to be able to combine times we meet with material found here on this site, which I am largely constructing as a kind of extended and expanded textbook for a course I had planned to teach in person only a few short months ago. </p>
<p>One of the first things to note is that this course has a <a href="https://textalytics.net/334/">syllabus</a> and a schedule, but that those are hosted with the syllabi and schedules of all my courses. The documentation here will, I hope, match that on the schedule, but if need to know dates or points, you will not find it in these pages. Here there will be only content, with links to material protected by copyright but available through fair use found on the course’s Moodle site as well as quizzes. See the <a href="https://textalytics.net/334/">syllabus</a> for other matters.</p>
<h2 id="11-what-is-this-course-about">1.1. What is this course about?</h2>
<p>Would it scare you if this course claimed to be about dimensionality reduction?The description of this course notes that: “Memes, fake news, trolling, rickrolling are all well-established forms of internet behavior and are as much a part of our everyday lives as grandma’s gumbo.” And that we will explore these phenomena through inspection, compilation, and distillation. What that means is that we will encounter a variety of scholarly explorations of forms both old and new and explore those forms at first individually, to get a feel for how they work, and then as collections where we can learn a lot just by challenging ourselves to sort things into categories. Congratulations, that sorting is a kind of dimensionality reduction. </p>
<p>Maybe another place to begin is to watch this brief video by fellow folklorist </p>
<p>Andrea Kitta on <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-x6gKUG6DTE">COVID-19 Gossip, Rumor, Legend, and Conspiracy Theories</a></p>
<h2 id="12-how-is-it-organized">1.2. How is it organized?</h2>
<p>This course was originally imagined as taking place in a classroom three days a week &ndash; Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 10 to 11, to be precise &ndash; but obviously in this pandemic moment, plans had to change. The good news is that we can have the best of both worlds: we can still talk with each other, if also through screens, but we can also be fully immersed in the digital realm that is our object of study. (You will just need to remind yourself that sometimes you&rsquo;re on TikTok for fun and sometimes you&rsquo;re on TikTok for class.)</p>
<h3 id="how-to-organize-yourself">How to organize yourself</h3>
<p>In her &ldquo;<a href="https://onlinelearninginsights.wordpress.com/2012/09/28/five-step-strategy-for-student-success-with-online-learning/">Five-step Strategy for Student Success with Online Learning</a>,” Debbie Morrison points out some obvious things—like read the syllabus, plan weekly study times, and log onto a course at least three times a week—as well as a couple less obvious things—like learning to, and making yourself, ask questions and making connections with fellow students. </p>
<p>Let’s discuss the obvious ones first, setting aside reading the syllabus and other course documents, like this one, as so obvious that anyone not &ldquo;reading the docs” probably shouldn’t be trusted to operate a pencil correctly. Not as obvious are the ones that involve time management, because in comparison with a regular go-to-class class, there is no fixed time, no place you have to be. You can be anywhere at any time, and that’s just dangerous. </p>
<p>It’s also tempting to try to binge a class, and sometimes that can work, but a lot of times it won’t, because your brain needs time to digest some material before it can take in more. Cramming before an exam only works, in all honesty, if you already know the material in some fashion. Cramming new material rarely works.</p>
<p>Pace yourself, which means setting aside time to go through the course materials <em>and</em> time to do the assigned reading and writing. The accompanying PDF is a blank weekly schedule that is there to help you block out your week. Use it not only for this class but for your other classes and for your other regular obligations. Put it some place where you will look at it everyday. And then make a note to revisit it and make changes for what works and what doesn’t. (Life is complicated: don’t make it harder than it has to be.)</p>
<p>As to the less obvious things you must do: <em>ask questions</em>. In most cases, you will be doing someone else a favor by asking a question they haven’t quite put into words yet. (We’re going to assume all of you are equally determined to get the most out of your education and so the second a question comes to you and you can put it in words, you are going to ask it. Okay?)</p>
<p>Finally, connect with someone else. In an in-person class, I ask students to do this in case they miss a class and need to get notes. In a remote class, it’s a good idea to swap notes with someone: you can see what you missed. <em>Make it happen</em>.</p>

<li>No less than 10 examples of object of study</li>
</ul>
<p>As a folklorist, I study anecdotes. Anecdotes are the stuff of life. They can even be objects of study. You just can&rsquo;t work with anecdotal evidence, in the sense that a small number of examples—sometimes only one—drawn from personal experience can serve as your data. It&rsquo;s perfectly fine to let your personal experience draw you towards an object of study, but once you have established that object, you need to collect (and analyze) objectively and purposefully; not casually, anecdotally.</p>
