Well, we do live in interesting times, don\u2019t we? Normally I would assure you that the importance of our current moment or the speed of change or the qualities of change we face is just something we arrogate to ourselves, that every era has felt much the same: all you need to do is head to your local library and ask the librarian to show you newspapers from the 1940s or 50s. Coal strikes. Atom bomb tests. The Cold War. But a global pandemic changes everything. It especially changes education, which is normally putting too many people into too small of a room inside buildings not well maintained. We can\u2019t do that. And so we fall back on distance learning technologies, which are neither better nor worse than face-to-face learning technologies, but different enough that few of us excel at it. So we are doing something different, and by reading this you are already in the middle of that difference: to the best of my ability, I hope to be able to combine times we meet with material found here on this site, which I am largely constructing as a kind of extended and expanded textbook for a course I had planned to teach in person only a few short months ago. One of the first things to note is that this course has a syllabus and a schedule, but that those are hosted with the syllabi and schedules of all my courses. The documentation here will, I hope, match that on the schedule, but if need to know dates or points, you will not find it in these pages. Here there will be only content, with links to material protected by copyright but available through fair use found on the course\u2019s Moodle site as well as quizzes. See the syllabus for other matters. 1.1. What is this course about? Would it scare you if this course claimed to be about dimensionality reduction?The description of this course notes that: \u201cMemes, fake news, trolling, rickrolling are all well-established forms of internet behavior and are as much a part of our everyday lives as grandma\u2019s gumbo.\u201d And that we will explore these phenomena through inspection, compilation, and distillation. What that means is that we will encounter a variety of scholarly explorations of forms both old and new and explore those forms at first individually, to get a feel for how they work, and then as collections where we can learn a lot just by challenging ourselves to sort things into categories. Congratulations, that sorting is a kind of dimensionality reduction. Maybe another place to begin is to watch this brief video by fellow folklorist Andrea Kitta on COVID-19 Gossip, Rumor, Legend, and Conspiracy Theories 1.2. How is it organized? This course was originally imagined as taking place in a classroom three days a week \u2013 Monday, Wednesday, Friday from 10 to 11, to be precise \u2013 but obviously in this pandemic moment, plans had to change. The good news is that we can have the best of both worlds: we can still talk with each other, if also through screens, but we can also be fully immersed in the digital realm that is our object of study. (You will just need to remind yourself that sometimes you\u2019re on TikTok for fun and sometimes you\u2019re on TikTok for class.) How to organize yourself In her \u201c Five-step Strategy for Student Success with Online Learning ,\u201d Debbie Morrison points out some obvious things\u2014like read the syllabus, plan weekly study times, and log onto a course at least three times a week\u2014as well as a couple less obvious things\u2014like learning to, and making yourself, ask questions and making connections with fellow students. Let\u2019s discuss the obvious ones first, setting aside reading the syllabus and other course documents, like this one, as so obvious that anyone not \u201creading the docs\u201d probably shouldn\u2019t be trusted to operate a pencil correctly. Not as obvious are the ones that involve time management, because in comparison with a regular go-to-class class, there is no fixed time, no place you have to be. You can be anywhere at any time, and that\u2019s just dangerous. It\u2019s also tempting to try to binge a class, and sometimes that can work, but a lot of times it won\u2019t, because your brain needs time to digest some material before it can take in more. Cramming before an exam only works, in all honesty, if you already know the material in some fashion. Cramming new material rarely works. Pace yourself, which means setting aside time to go through the course materials and time to do the assigned reading and writing. The accompanying PDF is a blank weekly schedule that is there to help you block out your week. Use it not only for this class but for your other classes and for your other regular obligations. Put it some place where you will look at it everyday. And then make a note to revisit it and make changes for what works and what doesn\u2019t. (Life is complicated: don\u2019t make it harder than it has to be.) As to the less obvious things you must do: ask questions . In most cases, you will be doing someone else a favor by asking a question they haven\u2019t quite put into words yet. (We\u2019re going to assume all of you are equally determined to get the most out of your education and so the second a question comes to you and you can put it in words, you are going to ask it. Okay?) Finally, connect with someone else. In an in-person class, I ask students to do this in case they miss a class and need to get notes. In a remote class, it\u2019s a good idea to swap notes with someone: you can see what you missed. Make it happen . What are the requirements? Scientific American \u2018s 60-Second Science series is billed as a podcast, and thus depends upon audio, but episodes regularly feature visuals \u2013 usually just one, and it\u2019s not a slide of bullet points but more often an image or a graph which is explained during the course of the episode. Multi-panel comic. Timeline of/with images. miniTEDtalk Horrible Histories sometimes features songs . Course Project No less than 10 examples of object of study As a folklorist, I study anecdotes. Anecdotes are the stuff of life. They can even be objects of study. You just can\u2019t work with anecdotal evidence, in the sense that a small number of examples\u2014sometimes only one\u2014drawn from personal experience can serve as your data. It\u2019s perfectly fine to let your personal experience draw you towards an object of study, but once you have established that object, you need to collect (and analyze) objectively and purposefully; not casually, anecdotally.","title":"1.
